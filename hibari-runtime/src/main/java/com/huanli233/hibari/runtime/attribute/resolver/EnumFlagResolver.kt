/**
 * Resolver for framework and resource-bag attribute symbols.
 *
 * Because the compiled resource table resolves enum/flag symbols (e.g. `gravity="center"`)
 * into integers at compile time, we must do the same at runtime when synthesizing a binary
 * `AttributeSet`. There is no compiler available at runtime, so the symbol -> int mapping
 * must be resolved another way.
 *
 * Resolution is layered:
 * - **T1 (default, [BuiltInEnumFlagResolver])**: a curated static table of the common framework
 *   symbols whose values are de-facto ABI and never change.
 * - **T2 ([AttributeBagResolver])**: read the attribute's bag (`ResTable_map`) at runtime via
 *   reflection to cover library / custom enum/flag attributes.
